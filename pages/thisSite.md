description: Why I made this personal site

In order to better understand myself and my development skills, I decided to start this site in April 2016.  The original intent for it is to organize my thoughts and tools over the years while hopefully trying to educate others on new technologies and workflows that might impact their life.

This personal website is a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site

Random things to know the difference of:

- TODO: Git vs Github vs Gist vs Github Pages
- TODO: Jekyll vs Non-Jekyll method
