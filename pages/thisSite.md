description: Why I made this personal site
---

In order to better understand myself and the things I come across in my life, I decided to start this site in early 2016.  The original intent for it is to organize my thoughts and tools over the years while hopefully trying to educate others on new technologies and workflows that he or she might find useful as well.

This website is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site, I like how Jekyll work and wanted to share it out there with anyone interested in web technology, more info in my blog post about [my choice of using jekyll]({% post_url 2016-04-13-why-a-jekyll-site %}).
