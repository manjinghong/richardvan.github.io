[live](http://www.richardvan.com/richardvan.project.mosaicHarbor/)

The intent of this project is to create a web view which will allow the user to visualize their home utilities in a graph.  Leveraging some google apps apis, I am able to public update a spreadsheet and then this data is graphically displayed live on this site.


TODO - be able to view the live version of website with an easy workflow to update it in my dev environment.
