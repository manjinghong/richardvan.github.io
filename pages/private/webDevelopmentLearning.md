### Front End

*A mix of programming and layout that powers the visuals and interactions of the web.*

If a website were a house, front end would be: The pretty exterior of the house that passersby can see, or the host who welcomes the guests in the house.

### Back End

*It’s the structure that allows information to be shared across accounts or people. It’s the glue that binds the internet together.*

If a website were a house, back end would be: The water supply, the electrical system that sustains the house and makes it live-able.

### Full Stack

*The front and back end are collectively called full stack. Its the whole package.*

If a website were a house, full stack would be: The house.
