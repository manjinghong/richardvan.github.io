What are the 10 most important things every programmer should know to succeed in the technology industry in 2016 and beyond?

#####
#       coding languages answer
####
-   Java. Java is not going away anytime soon. Most big companies have a lot of investment in Java. Java since 2000 is like COBOL in the 60's, impossible to skip.
-   JFloats are not precise enough. For handling money you should Fractions or BigDecimals... or BigFractions.
-   JUnicode and UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.
-   JVaadin. I think all the web frameworks will converge on Vaadin like frameworks.
-   JVert.x and node.js, also learn Express which is a framework on top of node.js.
-   JHsqldb. Blazing fast open source relational database engine written in just a few Java classes.
-   JCassandra. Infninitely scalable NoSql database cluster.
-   JAutomated unit testing (JUnit), automated acceptance testing (Selenium), continuous integration (Jenkins) and continuous delivery to production.
-   JHazelCast for creating high performance clustered apps easily.
-   JVagrant, Docker, Kubernettes.

#       overall answer

1. Web technologies. At a bare minimum a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2. Beyond that, understanding core web frameworks such as Angular, React/Redux. An understanding of API design principles, REST, Promises and asynchronous programming.
3. And beyond that, keeping on top of important core tech such as ES2015, PostCSS, SVG, Long Polling and WebSockets. In particular, understanding how long polling really works and how to scale such systems, such as how Quora has managed it.
4. Back end technologies. At a bare minimum an understanding of a web framework (Express, Flask, DropWizard, Spray), and relational database (Postgres, MySQL.)
5. Beyond that, a solid understanding of stateless systems, caching systems (redis, memcached, hazelcast, or as part of akka), a non-relational database (Cassandra, ElasticSearch, MongoDB) and a queueing system (RabbitMQ, Kafka.)
6. Build and deployment systems. Know how to use ssh. Be able to configure CircleCI/Travis. Setting up Jenkins, integrating github into build and release flows, and knowing how to follow git flow. Bash scripting. At least know about Puppet, chef, ansible, or salt for automation and configuration management. Understanding how a continuous delivery pipeline is built and the importance of a robust operational plane.
7. Cloud systems. Given that they lead the market, a solid understanding of AWS; e.g. at least two of EC2, S3, ELB, SQS/Kinesis, DynamoDB/Redshift.
8. Analytics. At least a basic understanding of modern large scale batch/stream processing systems. Hadoop, Spark, Spark streaming, etc.
9. Literacy. At least three of JavaScript, Python, Scala, Java, C#, Go.
10. Core architecture skills. OOP/SOLID, functional programming, TDD, layered systems, design patterns, IoC containers, along with a solid grounding in concurrency.
