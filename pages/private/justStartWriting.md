### 4/9/2016

Today I woke up, let the dogs out, fed them, and fed myself with a good yogurt exilir.  I also made sure I got in my pushups and then I read two blinks instead of watching Election 2.  It took willpower to shift away from Election 2 since I had just seen Y&D series last weekend and Election 1 last night.

I was able to get access to my old files from buying a SATA to USB adapter on Amazon that worked to allow me to read my old internal HDDs.  I have been transfering them into google drive and eventually plan to organize all my photos.

Within my old files I have been able to access my travel photos from phase 1 along with my old college projects which I have been looking for to upload to my person website.

I was able to get Jekyll to compile locally on my computer yesterday which I am pretty happy about.

Took Lucky on a walk before the rain/sunshine sporadically came and went. Made Longanisa, Eggs, and heated some on-choy for lunch with rice.  

Read up on beards and am considering a year length no haircut so I can tie it up one day for that look. Watched Election II. Did more research on famous people for my blog.  Researched my Chinese name.

### 4/10/2016
This morning woke up around 9 and did the usual routine including reading a quick blink on how champions think optimistically each day and work towards their goals.

Went to Walmart and KTP after to pick up morning yogurt elixir stuff and KTP to get some marinated pork, and kimchi that was $1 a pound but huge napa cuts.

Took Lucky on a walk around the neighborhood and let him go all and he was so happy. Now he lifts his foot up to pee and also he barks when he is maximum level of excitement.
