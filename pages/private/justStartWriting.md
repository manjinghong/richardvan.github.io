### 4/9/2016

Today I woke up, let the dogs out, fed them, and fed myself with a good yogurt exilir.  I also made sure I got in my pushups and then I read two blinks instead of watching Election 2.  It took willpower to shift away from Election 2 since I had just seen Y&D series last weekend and Election 1 last night.

I was able to get access to my old files from buying a SATA to USB adapter on Amazon that worked to allow me to read my old internal HDDs.  I have been transfering them into google drive and eventually plan to organize all my photos.

Within my old files I have been able to access my travel photos from phase 1 along with my old college projects which I have been looking for to upload to my person website.

I was able to get Jekyll to compile locally on my computer yesterday which I am pretty happy about.

Took Lucky on a walk before the rain/sunshine sporadically came and went. Made Longanisa, Eggs, and heated some on-choy for lunch with rice.  

Read up on beards and am considering a year length no haircut so I can tie it up one day for that look. Watched Election II. Did more research on famous people for my blog.  Researched my Chinese name.

Woke up early and fed the dogs then drove with Lucky to JG house where she, Desi, and I went to Red Rock Canyon together.  Had a good walk at Pine Creek Trail, Lucky was doing really well and it was a good day.  After that we home and prepared for JG BBQ for her bday. Jino, Mark, Sinead, Eric, Desi, Felipe, and Channing were there.  It was good cooking charcoal chicken and tri tip for them.  We ate, chilled, blazed, and then everyone went home.  Found out Sheryl had moved out that day, Mark staying until end of the month, Jino and Tara going to move all at once.

Started reading into Javascript design patterns.  Learned about the Singleton pattern which follows that there can only be one instance of a class at any given time.  Example is useful for something like a network connection provider class.

Brought Lucky in for his appointment in the morning and it went well.  His 8-10 sutures were removed and Dr. Lavengco said that he has made a full recovery.  There isn't study to support the long-term effects of increased pressure on the rest of his organs.

Watching the final game of Kobe Bryant, it's pretty amazing to see the support and level of dedication from current and past players.  They even named a metro stop after him two stops away from the Staple Center.  This is the final game of his 20 year career, it's amazing because he has done it that great for that long.
