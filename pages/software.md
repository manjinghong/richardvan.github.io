This is a list of software I commonly find myself using.  Hopefully you'll find a useful tool here.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) [100GB/mo for $2]

There are many cloud storage solutions out there but I like Google Drive because of it's pricing coupled with its external developer APIs. It's $2/month to store 100GB of data in the cloud.  I remember when I was once conned into buying a 32MB Compact Flash card for $100 at one of those privately owned camera stores a block away from Wall St. back in 2001.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)

I started using this in 2008 as it was one of the more popular cloud file store that also had a nice intuitive UI.  I current dedicate dropbox as the first place my photos (taken on my phone) are backed up to.  This is done automatically in the background.  It's very convenient just be able to just log into dropbox and view your images on a browser instead of your small phone screen.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Evernote](https://evernote.com) [Plus Membership, $24.99/yr]

I started using this in 2015 and it's been awesome able to store stuff I've read or even using it to organize my own files.

#### <a name="current"></a>[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) 

An open-source file editor developed by Adobe. I started using this in 2014 as my default editor.  It provides the power and flexibility such as powerful code editors like Microsoft Visual Studios and even XCode. 


#### <a name="current"></a>[Microsoft Office](https://products.office.com) 

Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are productivity tools for the computer, I have used multiple iterations of this product since I got my first computer in middle school. The industry standard format of information for a majority of email content sent to other people.

#### <a name="current"></a>[TurboTax](https://turbotax.com/) 

It's easy to file your own taxes, this product has served my well since 2011 with an intuitive interface and different tiers of offerings depending on your income/portfolio.


### Programming Languages

I have learned to varying degrees many programming languages over my lifetime. What you come to learn is that there are similiar core features such as (int,double,bool, arrays) you can expect to find in most widely used modern languages at all levels of the stack.  However, the semantics of how things work is different.  While I don't claim to be an expert in any of these programming languages, I have had experience with them.  Some more than others.





Turbo C - My first exposure to coding was during a computer class in summer school during high school.  


### Developer Programs and Tools

#### <a name="current"></a>[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) 

Highly recommended package manager for OSX, beyond your typical shell (in the form of **Terminal** on the Mac) commands such as **ls**,**mkdir**,**cd**,**pwd**,**mv**,**rm**, you might want helpful commands like **wget**, TODO_more, 


#### <a name="current"></a>[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 

Described as a Static Page Generator, this website is built from Jekyll.  Due to it's usefulness, I find myself immersed in technology more than ever before since I am writing about it now in the form of this blog.

### Software (I don't use anymore)


TODO - Terminal (talk about switching from Windows to Mac)

Technological shifts (in the world and in my realm of usage) come into when I thought of maintaining this list.  During my adolescences in the 1990's, I constantly interacted with technology, the difference then was that for a decade or so it wasn't connected to the internet like it is nowadays.  When I say connected, I am referring to the blazing fast speeds seen with streaming and the transfer of huge amounts of data online.

### Video Games (chronologically):

I have probably played well over 100 of video games on systems like the NES, Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Playstation, N64, Playstation 2, Xbox, Playstation 3, and the PC. The stories in those games and mechanics of how things work help raised my mindset since I was in gradeschool to some degree.  I have different priorities nowadays versus back then which has led me to devote a lot less time to video games.  In retrospect, here are some of my favorite video games that made the cut in my world.
