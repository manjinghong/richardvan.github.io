### For Projects hosted on github, keeping the master branch in sync with ghpages here
Add the following 2 lines to the [remote "origin"] section of .git/config:

    `push = +refs/heads/master:refs/heads/gh-pages`

    `push = +refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master`

Every time you push it will automatically push master to gh-pages as well.
