The words that both my dad and brother uttered after we found out the great news that Lucky's mass was benign.  Or not cancer which is how I've interpret it.  Lucky recently had a tumor the size of a grapefruit removed from his body.  This is the experience and story I wanted to reflect in this blog post for myself and to hopefully educate others as well.

**What I recapped to all the helpful people I talked to at the vet's office (from the lady that took my initial call, to the in-house staff, to the vet himself).**

Monday, March 21th - Two vomit spots found in house, mainly consisting of water and grass.  Lucky is not as hyper as normal. Still wants to go on a walk, but something is off.

Tuesday, March 22nd - Three vomit spots throughout the day, one of them on the couch. Mainly consisting of water and a jerky treat among dry nibble food that hasn't been processed. No sign of Lucky wanting to go outside.

Wednesday, March 23rd - Lucky not active in the morning, usually the sun will wake him up but I pass by him looking just laying down.  He does get up to urinate when I open the door for him and Boogie to go outside. Lucky starts rejecting his dry food and even treats. Other thing to note is that Lucky's pee is off color, it's getting darker (bold yellow with brownish spotty bits) as I am able to clearly see on one of the blue indoor peeing pads.

Thursday March 24th - In the morning, I noticed that Lucky's pee was an orange-ish hue which was troubling.  I suspected that there was blood or something.  I run some errands in the morning for a couple hours and come back to another pad that is significantly more red. I call the vet's office and explain the situation to the vet tech, she encourages me to bring him in.  I bring Lucky in, the place is busy, I sign in and wait for about 15 minutes before I get a waiting room.  I do note that I felt I was brought into a waiting room first ahead of some other patients. This was probably based on the visible condition of Lucky.  It is also important to note that Lucky was brought in for a vaccination booster the previous week.

**Back me in one of the waiting rooms at the vet office with the Veterinarian letting me know that Lucky is very sick and that numerous blood test would be required.**

Lucky had lost three and half pounds in the last week. Lucky's body is crashing.  At this point, it is speculated that Lucky could have gotten into something bad like eating rat poison or swallowing a penny.  He wants me to authorize him with the tools he needs to figure out what is wrong with Lucky.  Early estimate is around a grand.  I consult my sister and approve Lucky's vet to get started.  I head home and am notified that Lucky could be boarded up for at least two nights.

The vet calls a couple hours after Lucky is checked into the animal hospital. He ask if I could come back to talk to him in person. Some answers. Bad news to Worse news.

There is tumor next to Lucky's spleen the size of a baseball. There are three options at this point to move forward.

* Option A - Bring Lucky to an oncologist.
* Option B - Allow the vet to perform surgery.
* Option C - Bring Lucky home, he would have about a week to live.

**Give Lucky a fighting chance.**

After discussion with my immediate family we decided to go with Option B.

**Waiting.**

This was a rough patch of time for myself and the rest of my family.  The surgery took place two days after I brought Lucky in so that he could get his energy back up, rebalance his electrolytes, and find out his blood clotting times.

**Surgery is successful.**

The doctor calls to tell me that the surgery went well and that he was able to remove only what he needed to without cutting into arteries or other key organs.

Post-op this is a picture of what was removed from Lucky's body.  Lucky's doctor was kind enough to send me this picture he had taken with his phone.  On the left is his spleen which has the more coarse texture while the tumor is on the right.

**Easter Sunday- Lucky is cleared to go home**

Lucky was discharged after the vet bill was paid and we were given thorough explanation of care for him post surgery.  There were four types of pills given for him to take over the next two weeks: 1 pain, 1 inflammatory, and 2 antibiotics.

The results of the histopathology (five days after the surgery)

Benign. The mass is not cancer which was the initial assumption that made all positive feelings go downhill.  However, from this early morning phone call I was very relieved and able to sleep better now.

**So what was it? What happened?**

After consulting the doctor, we believe that the benign mass was a massive blood clot.  At some point over 3 months earlier the clot started to form  next to his spleen.  The spleens had a lot of blood going through it at any given time which added to it's growth.  It was undetected by both doctors that examined him and gave him his vaccinations.  In retrospect, it added some bulk to Lucky's body that made him look a little chubby. Now with the mass gone, he has a much more lean posture.

The mass ruptured which caused led to increased pressure on Lucky's lungs causing him to vomit and then later it was leaking blood into his bladder which was cause for his increasingly discolored urine.

**What I learned from this experience:**

I have a new found respect for Veterinarians and doctors in general.  Lucky's life was saved. I am happy and relieved that outcome of this was the best case scenario.  It made me realize that there are good things in life and I wanted to cherish this moment by writing this dedication to Lucky.  I hope that others can learn something from this. Something was off, you will know.

Lucky's veterinarian told me that these cases usually go undetected because an ultrasound would be require to catch it early on.  It is very rare if not expensive for someone to want a random ultrasound test performed on a healthy being.

**Closing thought.**

In the end, I am thankful.  Lucky can go on to live a normal life.  The experience and lessons taken away was priceless compared to the approximately $2,500 vet bill (TODO_scan and show). It has shown me the power of medicine and what it can do to alter the course of my world.
