description: tips picked up from others as well as my experience actually using them abroad

### 1.) Pack light

### 2.) Establish home base right away in new places

### 3.) Travel vs Vacation

### 4.) Digitalize your life

### 5.) Learn to say "hi" and "thank you" in the local language

### 6.) Start the day early

### 7.) Carry local currency

This way you'll always get the fair rate when you pay for something.  The currency would work but people helping you exchange money won't give you favorable rates.  You'll likely not know them and they'll give you a rate even worse than the money exchangers at the airports.  Think about how much inconvenience it is to have foreign currency and then having to go exchange it somewhere, which is why a *surcharge* is warranted.

**Pro Tip:** If you are going on a vacation (see above), then it might be worth it to have an idea of how much you're going to spend and stop by your favorite bank back at home to exchange money ahead of time.  Most banks will help you exchange notes from other countries.  For first world countries there is usually a two day turn-a-round but for some less developed countries it could take up to a week.  As long as your a client of the bank you're exchanging money at, they'll give you really good rates.

**Pro Tip:** Acquire an ATM card that reimburses ATM fees such as the [Charles Schwab High Yield Investor Checking Account] (http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account).  This card allowed me to withdraw money from ATMs of almost any bank I came across.  The ATM always give you cash in local currency and almost exactly at what the real exchange rate should be.  Don't forget to call and let the issuing companies of your bank cards know you are abroad.

### 8.) Use public transportation

### 9.) Have a rough plan but play it by ear.

Know when you *have* to leave, check visa rules


In other terms, stay flexible, things won't play itself

### 10.) Enjoy
